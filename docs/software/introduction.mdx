## Overview

The 01 project is an open-source ecosystem for artificially intelligent devices. By combining code-interpreting language models ("interpreters") with speech recognition and voice synthesis, the 01's flagship operating system ("01") can power conversational, computer-operating AI devices similar to the Rabbit R1 or the Humane Pin.

Our goal is to become the "Linux" of this new space—open, modular, and free for personal or commercial use.

<Note>The current version of 01 is a developer preview.</Note>

## Components

The 01 software consists of two main components:

### Server

The server runs on your computer and acts as the brain of the 01 system. It:

- Passes input to the interpreter
- Executes commands on your computer
- Returns responses

### Client

The client is responsible for capturing audio for controlling computers running the 01 server. It:

- Transmits audio to the server
- Plays back responses

## Customization

One of the key features of the 01 ecosystem is its modularity. You can:

- Use different language models
- Customize the system's behavior through profiles
- Create and integrate custom hardware

## Getting Started

To begin using 01:

1. [Install](/software/installation) the software
2. [Run](/software/run) the Server
3. [Connect](/hardware/01-light/connect) the Client

For more advanced usage, check out our guides on [configuration](/software/configure).

## Contributing

As an open-source project, we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're interested in improving the core software, developing new features, or creating custom hardware integrations, there are many ways to get involved.
