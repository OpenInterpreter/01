## Components

The 01 software consists of two main components:

### Server

The server runs on your computer and acts as the brain of the 01 system. It:

- Passes input to the interpreter
- Executes commands on your computer
- Returns responses

### Client

The client is responsible for capturing audio for controlling computers running the 01 server. It:

- Transmits audio to the server
- Plays back responses

## Customization

One of the key features of the 01 ecosystem is its modularity. You can:

- Use different language models
- Customize the system's behavior through profiles
- Create and integrate custom hardware

## Getting Started

To begin using 01:

1. [Install](/software/installation) the software
2. [Run](/software/server/introduction) the Server
3. [Connect](/hardware/01-light/connect) the Client

For more advanced usage, check out our guides on [configuration](/software/configure).
