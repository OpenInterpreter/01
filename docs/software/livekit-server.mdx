## Overview

Livekit is a powerful, open-source WebRTC server and client SDK that enables real-time audio and video communication. It's designed for applications that require robust, scalable real-time features.

### Key Features
- Real-time audio and video communication
- Scalable architecture
- Support for various platforms (web, mobile, desktop)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have navigated to the `software` directory before proceeding.

### Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the `/software` directory with the following content:

```env
ELEVEN_API_KEY=your_eleven_labs_api_key
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_ngrok_auth_token
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual API keys.

### Starting the Server

To start the Livekit server, run the following command:

```bash
poetry run 01 --server livekit
```

<Note>
Currently, our Livekit server only works with Deepgram and Eleven Labs. We are working to introduce all-local functionality as soon as possible. By setting your profile (see [Configure Your Profile](/software/configure)), you can still change your LLM to be a local LLM, but the `interpreter.tts` value will be ignored for the Livekit server.

## Livekit vs. Light Server

- **Livekit Server**: Designed for devices with higher processing power, such as phones, web browsers, and more capable hardware. It offers a full range of features and robust performance.

- **Light Server**: We have another lightweight server called the Light server, specifically designed for ESP32 devices. It's optimized for low-power, constrained environments.

## SDK Integration

Livekit provides SDKs for various programming languages and platforms, allowing you to easily integrate real-time communication features into your applications.

### Available SDKs

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- React
- React Native
- iOS (Swift)
- Android (Kotlin)
- Flutter
- Unity
