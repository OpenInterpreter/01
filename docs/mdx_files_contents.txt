You can create custom hardware that integrates with the O1 server software running on your computer.

To use 01 with your custom hardware, run the livekit server and connect to the "Livekit is running at..." URL that is displayed:

```bash
poetry run 01 --server livekit
```

Or, run the light server and connect to the URL that is displayed:

```bash
poetry run 01 --server light
```

You may need to set additional parameters via [flags](/software/flags) depending on your setup.

# Usage

## Light Server

When using the light server, to transmit audio commands to 01, send LMC audio chunks to the websocket defined by your server.

### LMC Messages

To support the incoming `L`anguage `M`odel `C`omputer architecture, we extend OpenAI's messages format to include additional information, and a new role called `computer`:

<Info> Make sure that you have navigated to the `/software` directory. </Info>

To run 01 with your computer's microphone and speaker, you need to start a server and a client.

We abstract this away with a simple command:

```bash
poetry run 01
```

*Tip:* While in the `/software` directory, you can run the following command to install the `01` command system-wide:

```bash
pip install .
```

Then, simply run `01` in your terminal to start the server + client and begin speaking to your assistant.

```bash
01
```

title: "Connect"
description: "Connect your 01 device to your 01 server"
---

### Connecting your 01 device to the server

1. Start the 01 server on your computer:
   ```
   poetry run 01 --server light
   ```
   This command starts the server and generates a URL.

   For remote connections, use:
   ```
   poetry run 01 --server light --expose
   ```
   This generates a public URL accessible from anywhere.

2. Connect your 01 device to the server using one of these methods:

   a) Hardcode credentials:
   - Modify the Wi-Fi and server credentials at the top of the `client.ino` file.
   - Flash the modified file to the ESP32.
   - This method is quick but less flexible for changing details later.

   b) Use the captive portal:
   - Power on your 01 device.
   - Connect to the '01-light' Wi-Fi network from your computer or smartphone.
   - A captive portal page should open automatically. If not, open a web browser.
   - Enter your Wi-Fi details and the server URL from step 1.
   - Click 'Connect' to save settings and connect your device.

After successful connection, your 01 device will be ready to communicate with the server.

       ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ### Windows Installation

    1. **Git**: Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

    2. **Python**: 
       - Download Python 3.11.x from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
       - During installation, ensure you check "Add Python to PATH".

    3. **Microsoft C++ Build Tools**:
       - Download from [Microsoft's website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
       - Run the installer and select "Desktop development with C++" from the Workloads tab.
       - This step is crucial for Poetry to work correctly.

    4. **Poetry**:
       - If the standard installation method fails due to SSL issues, try this workaround:
         1. Download the installation script from [https://install.python-poetry.org/](https://install.python-poetry.org/) and save it as `install-poetry.py`.
         2. Open the file and replace the `get(self, url):` method with:
            ```python
            def get(self, url):
                import ssl
                import certifi
                request = Request(url, headers={"User-Agent": "Python Poetry"})
                context = ssl.create_default_context(cafile=certifi.where())
                context.check_hostname = False
                context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
                with closing(urlopen(request, context=context)) as r:
                    return r.read()
            ```
         3. Run the modified script to install Poetry.
       - Add Poetry to your PATH:
         1. Press Win + R, type "sysdm.cpl", and press Enter.
         2. Go to the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables".
         3. Under "User variables", find "Path" and click "Edit".
         4. Click "New" and add: `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts`
         5. Click "OK" to close all windows.

    5. **FFmpeg**:
       - Download the latest FFmpeg build from the [BtbN GitHub releases page](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases).
       - Choose the `ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip` (non-shared suffix) file.
       - Extract the compressed zip file.
       - Add the FFmpeg `bin` folder to your PATH:
         1. Press Win + R, type "sysdm.cpl", and press Enter.
         2. Go to the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables".
         3. Under "System variables", find "Path" and click "Edit".
         4. Click "New" and add the full path to the FFmpeg `bin` folder (e.g., `C:\path\to\ffmpeg\bin`).
         5. Click "OK" to close all windows.

   ## Troubleshooting

   1. **Poetry Install Error**: If you encounter an error stating "Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required" when running `poetry install`, make sure you have properly installed the Microsoft C++ Build Tools as described in step 3 of the Windows installation guide.

   2. **FFmpeg Not Found**: If you receive an error saying FFmpeg is not found after installation, ensure that you've correctly added the FFmpeg `bin` folder to your system PATH as described in step 5 of the Windows installation guide.

   3. **Server Connection Issues**: If the server connects but you encounter errors when sending messages, double-check that all dependencies are correctly installed and that FFmpeg is properly set up in your PATH.

### Starting the Server

To start the Livekit server, run the following command:

```bash
poetry run 01 --server livekit
```

To generate a QR code for scanning

```bash
poetry run 01 --server livekit --qr
```

To expose over the internet via ngrok

```bash
poetry run 01 --server livekit --expose
```

In order to use the mobile app over the web, use both flags

```bash
poetry run 01 --server livekit --qr --expose
```

<Note>
  Currently, our Livekit server only works with Deepgram and Eleven Labs. We are
  working to introduce all-local functionality as soon as possible. By setting
  your profile (see [Configure Your Profile](/software/configure)), you can
  still change your LLM to be a local LLM, but the `interpreter.tts` value will
  be ignored for the Livekit server.
</Note>

# LiveKit Installation Guide for Windows

## Required Software

- Git
- Python (version 3.11.9 recommended)
- Poetry (Python package manager)
- LiveKit server for Windows
- FFmpeg

## Installation Steps

### 1. Python Installation

Install Python 3.11.9 (latest version < 3.12) using the binary installer.

### 2. Poetry Installation

Poetry installation on Windows can be challenging. If you encounter SSL certificate verification issues, try this workaround:

1. Download the installation script from [https://install.python-poetry.org/](https://install.python-poetry.org/) and save it as `install-poetry.py`.
2. Modify the `get(self, url):` method in the script to disable certificate verification:

   ```python
   def get(self, url):
       import ssl
       import certifi
       request = Request(url)
       context = ssl.create_default_context(cafile=certifi.where())
       context.check_hostname = False
       context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
       with closing(urlopen(request, context=context)) as r:
           return r.read()
   ```

3. Run the modified script to install Poetry.
4. Add Poetry's bin directory to your PATH:
   - Path: `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts`
   - Follow the guide at: [https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html)

### 3. LiveKit Server Installation

1. Download the latest release of LiveKit server for Windows (e.g., `livekit_1.7.2_windows_amd64.zip`).
2. Extract the `livekit-server.exe` file to your `/software` directory.

### 4. FFmpeg Installation

1. Download the FFmpeg Windows build from: [https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)
   - Choose the `ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip` (non-shared suffix) version.
2. Extract the compressed zip and add the FFmpeg bin directory to your PATH.

### 5. Final Setup

1. Run `poetry install`. If you encounter an error about Microsoft Visual C++, install "Microsoft C++ Build Tools":
   - Download from: [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
   - In the installation popup, select "Desktop Development with C++" with preselected components.

2. Set up your Anthropic API key:
   ```
   setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY [your_api_key]
   ```

3. Modify `main.py` to correctly locate and run the LiveKit server:
   - Set the LiveKit path:
     ```python
     livekit_path = "path/to/your/01/software/livekit-server"
     ```
   - Modify the server command for Windows:
     ```python
     f"{livekit_path} --dev --bind {server_host} --port {server_port}"
     ```
   > Note: Remove the `> /dev/null 2>&1` section from the command as it's not compatible with Windows.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter "ffmpeg not found" errors or issues when sending messages, ensure FFmpeg is correctly installed and added to your PATH.
- For any SSL certificate issues during installation, refer to the Poetry installation workaround provided above.

File: ./server/configure.mdx
---
title: "Configure"
description: "Configure your 01 instance"
---

A core part of the 01 server is the interpreter which is an instance of Open Interpreter.
Open Interpreter is highly configurable and only requires updating or creating a profile.
Properties such as `model`, `context_window`, and many more can be updated here.

To open the directory of all profiles, run:

```bash
# View profiles
poetry run 01 --profiles
```

To apply a profile to your 01 instance, use the `--profile` flag followed by the name of the profile:

```bash
# Use profile
poetry run 01 --profile <profile_name>
```

### Standard Profiles

`default.py` is the default profile that is used when no profile is specified. The default TTS is OpenAI.

`fast.py` uses elevenlabs and groq, which are the fastest providers.

`local.py` uses coqui TTS and runs the --local explorer from Open Interpreter.

### Custom Profiles

If you want to make your own file, you can do so by creating a new file in the `profiles` directory.
The easiest way is to duplicate an existing profile and then update values as needed. Be sure to save the profile with a unique name.

Remember to add `interpreter.tts = ` to set the text-to-speech provider.

To use a custom profile, run:

```bash
# Use custom profile
poetry run 01 --profile <profile_name>
```

### Example Profile

````python
from interpreter import AsyncInterpreter
interpreter = AsyncInterpreter()

# This is an Open Interpreter compatible profile.
# Visit https://01.openinterpreter.com/profile for all options.

# 01 supports OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and Coqui (Local) TTS providers
# {OpenAI: "openai", ElevenLabs: "elevenlabs", Coqui: "coqui"}
interpreter.tts = "openai"

# Connect your 01 to a language model
interpreter.llm.model = "gpt-4o"
interpreter.llm.context_window = 100000
interpreter.llm.max_tokens = 4096
# interpreter.llm.api_key = "<your_openai_api_key_here>"

# Tell your 01 where to find and save skills
interpreter.computer.skills.path = "./skills"

# Extra settings
interpreter.computer.import_computer_api = True
interpreter.computer.import_skills = True
interpreter.computer.run("python", "computer")  # This will trigger those imports
interpreter.auto_run = True
interpreter.loop = True
interpreter.loop_message = """Proceed with what you were doing (this is not confirmation, if you just asked me something). You CAN run code on my machine. If you want to run code, start your message with "```"! If the entire task is done, say exactly 'The task is done.' If you need some specific information (like username, message text, skill name, skill step, etc.) say EXACTLY 'Please provide more information.' If it's impossible, say 'The task is impossible.' (If I haven't provided a task, say exactly 'Let me know what you'd like to do next.') Otherwise keep going. CRITICAL: REMEMBER TO FOLLOW ALL PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS. If I'm teaching you something, remember to run the related `computer.skills.new_skill` function."""
interpreter.loop_breakers = [
    "The task is done.",
    "The task is impossible.",
    "Let me know what you'd like to do next.",
    "Please provide more information.",
]

# Set the identity and personality of your 01
interpreter.system_message = """

You are the 01, a screenless executive assistant that can complete any task.
When you execute code, it will be executed on the user's machine. The user has given you full and complete permission to execute any code necessary to complete the task.
Run any code to achieve the goal, and if at first you don't succeed, try again and again.
You can install new packages.
Be concise. Your messages are being read aloud to the user. DO NOT MAKE PLANS. RUN CODE QUICKLY.
Try to spread complex tasks over multiple code blocks. Don't try to complex tasks in one go.
Manually summarize text."""
````

### Hosted LLMs

The default LLM for 01 is GPT-4-Turbo. You can find this in the default profile in `software/source/server/profiles/default.py`.

The fast profile uses Llama3-8b served by Groq. You can find this in the fast profile in `software/source/server/profiles/fast.py`.

```python
# Set your profile with a hosted LLM
interpreter.llm.model = "gpt-4o"
```

### Local LLMs

You can use local models to power 01.

Using the local profile launches the Local Explorer where you can select your inference provider and model. The default options include Llamafile, Jan, Ollama, and LM Studio.

```python
# Set your profile with a local LLM
interpreter.llm.model = "ollama/codestral"

# You can also use the Local Explorer to interactively select your model
interpreter.local_setup()
```

### Hosted TTS

01 supports OpenAI and Elevenlabs for hosted TTS.

```python
# Set your profile with a hosted TTS service
interpreter.tts = "elevenlabs"
```

### Local TTS

For local TTS, Coqui is used.

```python
# Set your profile with a local TTS service
interpreter.tts = "coqui"
```

<Note>
  When using the Livekit server, the interpreter.tts setting in your profile
  will be ignored. The Livekit server currently only works with Deepgram for
  speech recognition and Eleven Labs for text-to-speech. We are working on
  introducing all-local functionality for the Livekit server as soon as
  possible.

title: "Measures"
description: "Essential steps to protect yourself when using 01"
---

**The 01 requires a proactive approach to safety.**

This section provides essential measures to protect your system and data when using the 01. Each measure is accompanied by specific tool recommendations to help you implement these safety practices effectively.

By following these guidelines, you can *somewhat* minimize risks and use the 01 with greater confidence— but **the 01 is nonetheless an experimental technology that may not be suitable for everyone.**

## 1. Comprehensive Backups

Before using the 01, ensure you have robust, up-to-date backups:

- Use reliable backup software to create full system images:
  - For Windows: [Macrium Reflect Free](https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree)
  - For macOS: Time Machine (built-in) or [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/)
  - For Linux: [Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/)
- Store backups on external drives or trusted cloud services like [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) or [iDrive](https://www.idrive.com/).
- Regularly test your backups to ensure they can be restored.
- Keep at least one backup offline and disconnected from your network.

Remember: A good backup is your last line of defense against unintended changes or data loss.

## 2. Use a Dedicated Environment

Isolate the 01 to minimize potential damage:

- Run the 01 in a virtual machine if possible. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is a free, cross-platform option.
- If not, create a separate user account with limited permissions for 01 use.
- Consider using a separate, non-essential device for 01 experiments.

## 3. Network Isolation

Limit the 01's ability to affect your network:

- Use a firewall to restrict the 01's network access. Windows and macOS have built-in firewalls; for Linux, consider [UFW](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW).
- Consider running the 01 behind a VPN for an additional layer of isolation. [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) offers a free tier.
- Disable unnecessary network services when using the 01.

## 4. Vigilant Monitoring

Stay alert during 01 usage:

- Pay close attention to the 01's actions and your system's behavior.
- Be prepared to quickly terminate the 01 if you notice anything suspicious.
- Regularly check system logs and monitor for unexpected changes.

## 5. Careful Command Formulation

Be precise and cautious with your voice commands:

- Start with simple, specific tasks before attempting complex operations.
- Avoid ambiguous language that could be misinterpreted.
- When possible, specify limitations or constraints in your commands.

## 6. Regular System Audits

Periodically check your system's integrity:

- Review important files and settings after using the 01.
- Use system comparison tools to identify changes made during 01 sessions:
  - For Windows: [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/)
  - For macOS/Linux: [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/)
- Promptly investigate and address any unexpected modifications.

## 7. Stay Informed

Keep up with 01 developments:

- Regularly check for updates to the 01 software.
- Stay informed about newly discovered risks or vulnerabilities.
- Follow best practices shared by the 01 developer community.

By following these measures, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with using the 01. Remember, your active involvement in maintaining safety is crucial when working with this powerful, experimental technology.

File: ./safety/introduction.mdx
---
title: "Introduction"
description: "Critical safety information for 01 users"
---

<Warning>This experimental project is under rapid development and lacks basic safeguards. Until a stable `1.0` release, **only run the 01 on devices without access to sensitive information.**</Warning>

The 01 is an experimental voice assistant that can execute code based on voice commands. This power comes with significant risks that all users must understand.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    Understand the dangers
  </Card>
  <Card title="Safety Measures" href="/safety/measures">
    Protect yourself and your system
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Safety Matters

The 01 directly interacts with your system, executing code without showing it to you first. This means:

1. It can make changes to your files and system settings instantly.
2. Misinterpretations of your commands can lead to unintended actions.
3. The AI may not fully understand the context or implications of its actions.

Always approach using the 01 with caution. It's not your usual voice assistant – **the 01 is a powerful tool that can alter your digital environment in seconds.**

<Warning>Remember: The 01 is experimental technology. Your safety depends on your understanding of its capabilities and limitations.</Warning>

File: ./safety/risks.mdx
---
title: "Risks"
description: "Understanding the dangers of using 01"
---

The 01 voice assistant offers powerful control over your digital environment through natural language commands. 

However, this capability comes with **significant risks.** Understanding these risks is crucial for safe and responsible use of the 01.

This section outlines the key dangers associated with the 01's ability to execute code instantly based on voice input. Being aware of these risks is the first step in using the 01 effectively and safely.

## Immediate Code Execution

The 01 executes code directly based on voice commands, without showing you the code first. This means:

- Actions are taken instantly, giving you no chance to review or stop them.
- Misinterpretations of your commands can lead to immediate, unintended consequences.
- Complex or ambiguous requests might result in unexpected system changes.

## System and Data Vulnerability

Your entire system is potentially accessible to the 01, including:

- Important files and documents
- System settings and configurations
- Personal and sensitive information

A misinterpreted command could lead to data loss, system misconfiguration, or privacy breaches.

## Prompt Injection Vulnerability

The 01 processes text from various sources, making it susceptible to prompt injection attacks:

- Malicious instructions could be hidden in emails, documents, or websites.
- If the 01 processes this text, it might execute harmful commands without your knowledge.
- This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or system compromise.

## Lack of Context Understanding

While powerful, the 01's AI may not fully grasp the broader context of your digital environment:

- It might not understand the importance of certain files or settings.
- The AI could make changes that conflict with other software or system requirements.
- Long-term consequences of actions might not be apparent to the AI.

## Experimental Nature

Remember, the 01 is cutting-edge, experimental technology:

- Unexpected behaviors or bugs may occur.
- The full extent of potential risks is not yet known.
- Safety measures may not cover all possible scenarios.

Understanding these risks is crucial for safe use of the 01. Always err on the side of caution, especially when dealing with important data or system configurations.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenInterpreter/01/main/docs/assets/Upload.png" alt="Upload firmware" width="80%" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the 01 server">
    Start the 01 server on your computer:
    ```
    poetry run 01 --server light
    ```
    This command starts the server and generates a URL.

    For remote connections, use:
    ```
    poetry run 01 --server light --expose
    ```
    This generates a public URL accessible from anywhere.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect ESP32 to the server">
    Connect your 01 device to the server using one of these methods:

    a) Hardcode credentials:
    - Modify the Wi-Fi and server credentials at the top of the `client.ino` file.
    - Flash the modified file to the ESP32.
    - This method is quick but less flexible for changing details later.

    b) Use the captive portal:
    - Power on your 01 device.
    - Connect to the '01-light' Wi-Fi network from your computer or smartphone.
    - A captive portal page should open automatically. If not, open a web browser.
    - Enter your Wi-Fi details and the server URL from step 1.
    - Click 'Connect' to save settings and connect your device.

    After successful connection, your ESP32 will be ready to communicate with the server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

![A mini Android phone running the 01 App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenInterpreter/01/main/docs/assets/app.png)

The 01 App connects to the 01 server on your home machine, enabling remote access to your files, apps, and IoT devices.

# Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install 01">
    Install the 01 software on your computer. For detailed instructions, visit the [installation guide](/setup/installation).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Livekit">
    Setup Livekit on your computer. For instructions, visit the [installation guide](/server/livekit).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the server">
    Open a terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    poetry run 01 --server livekit --expose --qr
    ```

    This will start the 01 server with LiveKit support, expose it to the internet, and generate a QR code. You may need to wait up to 30 seconds before the code is displayed.
    
    If the server fails, you may need to restart the server a few times before it works again. We're working on resolving this as soon as possible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect the app">
    Open the 01 App on your mobile device and use it to scan the QR code displayed in your terminal. This will establish a connection between your mobile device and the 01 server running on your computer.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Settings

The 01 App offers several customizable settings to enhance your experience. These can be changed by connecting to the server, then hitting the gear icon in the upper right, and adjusting the following settings:

## <Icon icon="microphone" /> Push-to-talk

Hold the on-screen button to activate listening, or use voice activity detection for hands-free operation.

## <Icon icon="watch" /> Wearable Mode

Optimizes the interface for small screens, displaying a minimal full-screen button without the chat interface.

## <Icon icon="ear-listen" /> Always Listen for Context

Continuously gathers environmental context, even when not actively prompted. Only available when Push-to-talk is enabled.


File: ./client/desktop.mdx
<Info>This client uses the [light](/server/light) server.</Info>

The desktop client for 01 provides a simple way to interact with the 01 light server using your computer. There are two main ways to use the desktop client:

## Simulating 01 Light Hardware

To simulate the 01 light hardware device on your desktop, run:

```
poetry run 01 --client
```

This will start the client in simulation mode. You can hold the CTRL key to talk to the 01 light server, simulating the button press on the physical device.

## Running Both Server and Client

To run both the server and client simultaneously, use:

```
poetry run 01
```

This command starts both the 01 light server and the desktop client, allowing you to interact with the system immediately. The client interface will guide you through the interaction process.

<Info>This client uses the [light](/server/light) server.</Info>

**Thank you [eladekkal](https://github.com/eladdekel) for your native iOS contribution!**

To run it on your device, you can either install the app directly through the current TestFlight [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/v8SyuzMT), or build from the source code files in Xcode on your Mac.

### Instructions

- [Install 01 software](/software/installation) on your machine

- In Xcode, open the 'zerooone-app' project file in the project folder, change the Signing Team and Bundle Identifier, and build.

### Using the App

To use the app there are four features:

1. The speak "Button"

Made to emulate the button on the hardware models of 01, the big, yellow circle in the middle of the screen is what you hold when you want to speak to the model, and let go when you're finished speaking.

2. The settings button

Tapping the settings button will allow you to input your websocket address so that the app can properly connect to your computer.

3. The reconnect button

The arrow will be RED when the websocket connection is not live, and GREEN when it is. If you're making some changes you can easily reconnect by simply tapping the arrow button (or you can just start holding the speak button, too!).

4. The terminal button

The terminal button allows you to see all response text coming in from the server side of the 01. You can toggle it by tapping on the button, and each toggle clears the on-device cache of text.
