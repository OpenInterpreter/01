# Context

1. **Be minimal.**

Both to developers (the 01 should be very programmer friendly) and to the end user.

2. **Develop standards.**

That should be compatible with other popular systems.

3. **Resonate strongly with a niche.**

We need to pick a niche. I wonder if startups is the right niche for us (use the 01 to build and sell your own Tab, Pin, Rabbit, etc) or if we should go with education, as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino did. Computer science departments is where UNIX took hold.

4. **Be affordable.**

The most hackable, most basic 01 MUST be under $100, ideally under $70.

5. **Be open-source.**

### UNIX

**ChatGPT:**

Unix succeeded for several reasons related to its design, philosophy, and historical context:

1. **Simplicity and Elegance**: Unix was designed with a clear, minimalist approach. It emphasized small, modular utilities that did one thing and did it well. This contrasted with the monolithic designs of other operating systems of its era.

2. **Portability**: Unix was rewritten in C by Dennis Ritchie. This was a crucial decision, as it allowed Unix to be easily ported across different hardware platforms, unlike other operating systems that were tied to specific hardware.

3. **Open Source (Initially)**: Unix's source code was made available to universities and researchers. This encouraged widespread adoption and modification, fostering a community of developers and users. This was a stark contrast to the proprietary nature of many other systems.

4. **Academic and Commercial Adoption**: Unix found a strong user base in academic settings, particularly in computer science departments. This helped in its evolution and spread. Its adoption by AT&T and subsequent commercialization also played a key role.

5. **Network and Internet Development**: Unix played a significant role in the development of the Internet. Tools and protocols developed on Unix systems (like TCP/IP) became standards.

6. **Influential Derivatives**: Unix led to the creation of numerous derivatives, including BSD, Solaris, and Linux. Each of these carried forward Unix principles and contributed to the overall ecosystem.

7. **Programmer-Friendly Environment**: Unix provided a powerful programming environment with tools like the shell, which were not as prevalent or sophisticated in other operating systems at the time.

8. **Standardization Efforts**: Efforts like POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standardized Unix system interfaces, enhancing compatibility across different Unix versions, which helped in its adoption in various industries.

These decisions and factors, among others, contributed to Unix's widespread success and enduring legacy in the world of computing.

### Linux

**ChatGPT:**

Linux succeeded due to several key decisions and factors in its history:

1. **Open Source Model**: Linux was released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which allowed anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software. This open-source model fostered a large, collaborative community of developers and users who continuously improved the system.

2. **Timing and Context**: Linux emerged in the early 1990s, when the computing world was looking for an affordable, reliable alternative to the expensive UNIX systems. There was a gap in the market for an operating system that was both powerful and accessible, which Linux filled.

3. **Unix Compatibility**: Linux was designed to be compatible with UNIX, which was already popular in academic and research circles. This made it easier for UNIX users to adopt Linux.

4. **Modularity and Customizability**: Linux's modular design allowed users to tailor the system to their needs, whether for personal computers, servers, or later, for embedded systems. This flexibility made it attractive to a wide range of users.

5. **Community and Collaboration**: The collaborative nature of the Linux community, led by Linus Torvalds, encouraged rapid development and problem-solving, which kept the system robust and up-to-date.

6. **Internet and Networking Capabilities**: Early on, Linux embraced internet and networking capabilities, making it ideal for running servers, particularly web servers. This became a huge factor in its adoption in the enterprise sector.

7. **Corporate Adoption and Support**: Over time, major corporations like IBM, HP, and later Google with Android, embraced Linux, contributing to its development and integrating it into their products and services.

8. **Adaptability to Different Hardware**: Linux's ability to run on a wide range of hardware, from PCs to supercomputers, made it versatile and widened its user base.

9. **Strong Leadership**: Linus Torvalds' leadership and vision were crucial. His decisions on the kernel development and his role as a somewhat benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) ensured consistency and focus in Linux's development.

10. **Free Software Movement**: Linux benefited from the broader Free Software Movement, gaining ideological support and contributors who believed in the principles of free and open software.

These decisions and circumstances converged to make Linux a highly successful, widely-used operating system, dominant in servers, supercomputing, and a key player in desktops and embedded systems.

### Raspberry Pi

**ChatGPT:**

The Raspberry Pi succeeded due to a combination of strategic decisions, market positioning, and its underlying philosophy. Here's a concise breakdown:

**Educational Focus:** Initially designed for education, it aimed to improve computer science teaching. The simple, accessible design and low cost made it appealing for schools and hobbyists alike.

**Affordability:** Priced at about $35, it was significantly cheaper than other computers, making technology more accessible. This low price was a key decision that set it apart from competitors.

**Open Source and Community:** Embracing open-source software and encouraging community involvement allowed for a wide range of applications and modifications, fostering a strong user community.

Versatility: Despite its simplicity and low cost, the Raspberry Pi was surprisingly versatile. It could be used for everything from learning programming to building complex projects like home automation systems.

Regular Updates: The Raspberry Pi Foundation frequently updated the hardware, offering more powerful versions while maintaining affordability and backward compatibility.

Broad Appeal: While initially targeted at students, its appeal broadened to hobbyists, makers, and professionals, expanding its market significantly.

Partnerships and Distribution: Strategic partnerships and distribution agreements helped make the Raspberry Pi widely available globally.

Promotion of STEM Education: By promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education, the Raspberry Pi tapped into a growing emphasis on these areas in education.

### Arduino

**ChatGPT:**

The Arduino succeeded primarily due to:

User-Friendly Design: Its simple, open-source design made it accessible for beginners in electronics and programming.
Community and Ecosystem: A strong community and a vast ecosystem of shields (add-ons) and software libraries allowed for a wide range of applications.
Educational Focus: Like the Raspberry Pi, it was widely adopted in education for teaching electronics and programming, appealing to students and hobbyists.
Affordability: Relatively low cost made it accessible to a broader audience, encouraging experimentation and learning.

### Pebble

Failed because it didn't have a very clear, singular vision (Eric told me this)

### Pinephone

Eric from Pebble told me that Pinephone is willing to use some proprietary software, not hardcore dedicated to making everything OSS. I thought this was interesting. Pinephone is way better than the Librem I'm told, and way cheaper, because of this. Hardcore OSS everything from the source isn't always the way, it can be very expensive and lead to failure.
