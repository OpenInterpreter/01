# Roadmap

Our goal is to power a billion devices with the 01OS over the next 10 years. The Cambrian explosion of AI devices. 

We can do that with your help. Help extend the 01OS to run on new hardware, to connect with new peripherals like GPS and cameras, and add new locally running language models to unlock use-cases for this technology that no-one has even imagined yet. 

In the upcoming weeks, we're going to release: 

- [ ] An open-source language model for computer control
      
- [ ] An app for your phone
      
- [ ] A hand-held device that runs fully offline.

- [ ] Train model optimized for computer control

- [ ] Publish open source protocols and benchmarks

- [ ] Expanding the devices supported by 01OS
